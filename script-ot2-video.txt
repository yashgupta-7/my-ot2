Ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has escalated the demand for fast, efficient and low resource 
methods for testing large masses. 
Tapestry Testing is a groud breaking idea which intends to do it both fast and efficient
using the scientific ideas of Compressed Sensing. 
Samples are intelligently pooled and tests preformed on those groups. Through algorithmic 
analysis, the positive samples can be identified with unbelievable precision.
This can be done more robustly through an automated robotic liquid handler, Opentrons OT-2, 
making it faster, low human resource and thus, incredibly scalable.
The current configuration with an 8 channel pippete and 96 well plates can handle 576 samples at a time. 
These are smartly delivered into 72 pooled samples, which are then tested for the virus.
The entire thing completes in around 100 minutes and requires a single human hand for very brief 
periods for time.
Newer configurations with 16 channel pippettes and 384 well plates will increase both
scalability and speed.
